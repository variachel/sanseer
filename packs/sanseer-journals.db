The green jewel that formed the centre of the sceptre's head is otherwise known as @JournalEntry[Of1qZaEFgem9VTKB]{The Lost Heart of O'Shan}. This jewel is thought to have been found and cut by a @JournalEntry[fj21otTBB5oc6Dcs]{Meredin} jewel smith by the name of @JournalEntry[QRPyd13l2mylCV3P]{Jas'mar Sokur}. Sokur was a follower of the ancient Meredin goddess @JournalEntry[jjZVEFlbu7br7i8N]{O'Shan}. He named the jewel in reference to one of the ancient tales of O'Shan. He presented it to the then emperor of Meredin as a gift. The emperor was pleased but had Sokur beheaded as he did not want him crafting one that could possibly outdo the Heart and the emperor must have the best in the world. Sokur's work is highly sought after.</li>\n<li><strong>The Head</strong>. The head itself is a gold latticed casement which opens and has a setting in which to place the jewel. It has long been thought that this was made by the legendary goldsmith @JournalEntry[o0eRvO1SBCExUd3P]{T'Vran Malgrave}. In general, pieces by him are sought after and would, if provenance could be verified, be worth an insane amount of money. Its history is less clear than the Heart. Malgrave was also from Meredin. This piece of work was more than likely made before the Heart. It may well have been the emperors collection for some time before he was presented with the Heart.</li>\n<li><strong>The Staff</strong>. This has a setting at one end that will accept the head of the Sceptre. The staff is made from an ancient Yew Tree, that as far as Osric knows is still living. Many rumours abound as to its whereabouts but that is not the focus of this task. The people of Meredin believed in opposing forces coming together to become something more powerful due to that conflict. The staff made from the Yew Tree is very much a passive earth energy. While the Heart is also of the earth it at some point was imbued with conflicting magic. These two put together and amplified by the golden lattice made the Sceptre very powerful.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>The then emperor of Meredin, @JournalEntry[kGzxoTVtwR3Edq3i]{Pir'Lanash}, was not entirely sane and he studied the dark magics which led him to put these three elements together. With the Sceptre he maintained power long after he would naturally have died. His reign was not a pleasant one either. Finally he was taken down and the Sceptre broken and the pieces lost. But there have always been clues for those who knew where to look. Fortunately those people are very very few. Osric is dubious about finding all the pieces again but unless the Sceptre needs the wielding of those ancient magicks and they have been lost. No-one now lives who understands them.</p>\n<p>Osric has since stated that the meaning of Vor Layder in the ancient languages is <strong>'Stone of Dread and Fear'</strong>.</p>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"y4pRACjo50IZ62pc":3},"flags":{}}

Having been married to the somewhat abusive, @JournalEntry[DsoostwDcCWbrtFg]{Garan Conway}, a captain of the guards at @JournalEntry[zwoPmdRTNCzjKSgX]{Claybrook Hall}, she became a widow upon Leon's well-placed blow to Conway's jaw during a fight instigated by Conway himself. To a certain degree he had good reason to be that belligerent as Leon had been having an affair with Esmeralda, the two having met during Leon's time a Claybrook Hall. That Esmeralda was physically abused by her husband was one of the main reasons that she fell into a relationship with Leon. Of course, she was as admiring of his charms as he was of hers.</p>\n<p>After her husband's death, she was retained by the Claybrooks. @JournalEntry[97x2utIAqSVb7fEN]{Harland Claybrook} had suspected that his guard captain was hurting Esmeralda but was initially reluctant to step into the relationship between the man and his wife, mainly as a matter of principle. Conway's abuse became too obvious though and Harland eventually had words with Garan Conway about his behaviour. He was most disappointed to find that his words had fallen of deaf ears. Harland perhaps would not have known but his words with Conway most likely resulted in more physical abuse on Esmeralda.</p>\n<p>On the day of his death and prior to trawling round the taverns in the centre of @JournalEntry[wIIvMqJJxCnuPxPB]{Ragarth} and finding Leon, Conway had confronted his wife and left her battered and bleeding at their home. She was found by another lady's maid and the alarm was raised. Esmeralda was only just able to state that her husband had gone to the city looking for Leon. Harland and is brothers and a few men had left Claybrook Hall to find either or both. As it happened all that they did find was a gathering of people around the now deceased Garan Conway.</p>\n<p>They gathered as much information as possible from the witnesses there and organised a man-hunt for Leon. However, the latter had used his skills to avoid being seen leaving Ragarth, ultimately arriving at @JournalEntry[drmEVSH8cvkBtLiH]{Sanseer City}.</p>\n<p>As Esmeralda recovered she was able to relate the whole story to Harland, @JournalEntry[24KQiXOhiDL3CSL2]{Fran Claybrook} and @JournalEntry[w7mrkYSI9N6PknFx]{Evan Claybrook}. The brothers had a great deal of sympathy for Esmeralda and Harland in particular felt some responsibility for her condition, believing that if he had acted more demonstrably and sooner that all of the recent events would have not transpired as they did. Esmeralda believes that the search for Leon was more a matter of being seen to do the right thing, especially as the full story of the fight became known.</p>\n<p>It was suggested to Esmeralda that she remain with the family in their employ should she so wish and that she should, perhaps, revert to her maiden name of Hayset. Evan further suggested that she should use an alternative version of her first name and so she became known as Relda Hayset from that point on.</p>\n<p>She believes that had the Claybrooks caught up with Leon they would have sought some justice or reparation but she suspects that the brothers, on learning the full tale of her life with Conway, felt that her dead husband more or less deserved what had been coming to him.</p>\n<p>Relda will aid Leon and Grim as she still cares for the errant rogue and is grateful that he, despite the extremity of the solution, freed her from \"that bastard of a husband\".</p>\n</div>","img":"modules/sanseer/media/journals/characters/portraits/hayset-relda-1.jpg","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"y4pRACjo50IZ62pc":3},"flags":{}}

Quelled his quivering by cutting his throat, slowly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<h2>Marta Lyle</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Knew nothing truly important. How that can be for someone who was purported to be a scryer escapes me. I'll never understand people's aversion to torture, it always seems to work for me. I didn't really need to put this woman on the rack (amongst other things) but it was pleasant to cause some unnecessary pain. Eviscerating her was satisfying too. She did spill some beans however, prior to spilling her guts that is. Spluttered out the name of a man in Halith in the end, one Doren con Grath, who she thought might have more information. Don';t know if she thought that would save her. Ah, the deluded hopes of the weak.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Â </p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sent one of the minor acolytes to Halith to pull the information from Grath. These worms are always looking to please and climb the ladder. Well, I let them try. It pleases me to see them writhing around trying to get the better of each other. Probably lose more of these little piss ants to playing that game than to a bloody battle. I gave the worm some explicit instructions as to how Doren con Grath should die after he had talked. I want certain deaths to be known to be the will of the Twelve. The cretin let him live - or at least let him escape which is the same thing - forcing me to send another. Seeing as the shit-stain had come back empty-handed I slowly cut his hands off as an object lesson. His wailing as a result of this punishment became too much, so I roasted him on a spit for the others to see.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p>The second cretinous worm I sent to Halith actually managed to surmount his mental deficiencies and return with some useful information - and the head of Doren con Grath. I think he was looking to gain some favour with this little embellishment to my plan. I considered relieving him of his own head but decided against it. After all he got the job done. Call it a whimsy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p>It seems further clues lie in Perdingham.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p>If it were not for Grath's information, I would not be in this dripping, stinking den, surrounded by fools. What's more that detestable, licentious man Victor Drayton has come here. Smells like a brewery. If I had not required him I would not be in this hideous position of having to open my legs to him to keep him on-side. At least the sacrifice of that 'pure as snow' daughter of mine should cleanse me of Drayton';s inebriated and inept fumblings. I do not yet know if he has worked out he will soon be a loose end. His sexual predilections have now stretched to my daughter to the point that he thinks that she is his reward. Plans to flee to Sha-Ren Tar I believe. This man's ridiculousness could almost make me laugh and vomit simultaneously.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p>So now to discover - or re-discover Perdingham. The village was âlost'; an age ago in Norgorber knows what calamity. Somewhere in these accursed mountains it lies. And apparently in eternal night, although that may be just a clichÃ©.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p>The day approaches. Oh so pretty Holly will die under my blades and I will subsume her life and her youth. Then I'll put a cat amongst the pigeons of the Twelve.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>","img":null,"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"y4pRACjo50IZ62pc":3},"flags":{}}

Beyond that point, House Claybrook holds sway. There have long been petty disputes between these two families, although some general truce is in existence.</p>\n<h2>Claybrook</h2>\n<p>The Claybrooks are a relatively less powerful family. Their lands do not extend much northwards or southwards. They do however have responsibility for and control the port of Ragarth (the family seat). This port connects directly to the second continent of San Katarin. The family is generally held to be aggrieved by the lower status they hold despite the importance of their involvement in trade with San Katarin. This trade is the source of their wealth.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Bettesthorne</h3>\n<h3>Estney</h3>\n<h3>Fletewoode</h3>\n<h3>Goodryke</h3>\n<h3>Wade</h3>\n</div>","img":"modules/sanseer/media/journals/houses/keron-houses.png","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"y4pRACjo50IZ62pc":3},"flags":{}}

He likes Holly, believing her to be the best of the family.</p>\n<p>He has denied the accounts of Holly being at the Marshall of Kesh, another one of his enterprises stations. He had been suspicious of The Innkeeper for some while. Not only was the man rather strange but he was skimming more than Inglis would reasonably expect a factor to skim.
