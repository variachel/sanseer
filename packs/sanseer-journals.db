The green jewel that formed the centre of the sceptre's head is otherwise known as <span style=\"color:#bf2e0a\">@JournalEntry[Of1qZaEFgem9VTKB]{The Lost Heart of O'Shan}</span>. This jewel is thought to have been found and cut by a <span style=\"color:#bf2e0a\">@JournalEntry[fj21otTBB5oc6Dcs]{Meredin}</span> jewel smith by the name of <span style=\"color:#bf2e0a\">@JournalEntry[QRPyd13l2mylCV3P]{Jas'mar Sokur}</span>. Sokur was a follower of the ancient Meredin goddess <span style=\"color:#bf2e0a\">@JournalEntry[jjZVEFlbu7br7i8N]{O'Shan}</span>. He named the jewel in reference to one of the ancient tales of O'Shan. He presented it to the then emperor of Meredin as a gift. The emperor was pleased but had Sokur beheaded as he did not want him crafting one that could possibly outdo the Heart and the emperor must have the best in the world. Sokur's work is highly sought after.</li>\n<li><strong style=\"color:#f34d1f\">The Head</strong>. The head itself is a gold latticed casement which opens and has a setting in which to place the jewel. It has long been thought that this was made by the legendary goldsmith <span style=\"color:#bf2e0a\">@JournalEntry[o0eRvO1SBCExUd3P]{T'Vran Malgrave}</span>. In general, pieces by him are sought after and would, if provenance could be verified, be worth an insane amount of money. Its history is less clear than the Heart. Malgrave was also from Meredin. This piece of work was more than likely made before the Heart. It may well have been the emperors collection for some time before he was presented with the Heart.</li>\n<li><strong style=\"color:#f34d1f\">The Staff</strong>. This has a setting at one end that will accept the head of the Sceptre. The staff is made from an ancient Yew Tree, that as far as Osric knows is still living. Many rumours abound as to its whereabouts but that is not the focus of this task. The people of Meredin believed in opposing forces coming together to become something more powerful due to that conflict. The staff made from the Yew Tree is very much a passive earth energy. While the Heart is also of the earth it at some point was imbued with conflicting magic. These two put together and amplified by the golden lattice made the Sceptre very powerful.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The then emperor of Meredin, <span style=\"color:#bf2e0a\">@JournalEntry[kGzxoTVtwR3Edq3i]{Pir'Lanash}</span>, was not entirely sane and he studied the dark magics which led him to put these three elements together. With the Sceptre he maintained power long after he would naturally have died. His reign was not a pleasant one either. Finally he was taken down and the Sceptre broken and the pieces lost. But there have always been clues for those who knew where to look. Fortunately those people are very very few. Osric is dubious about finding all the pieces again but unless the Sceptre needs the wielding of those ancient magicks and they have been lost. No-one now lives who understands them.</p>\n<p>Osric has since stated that the meaning of Vor Layder in the ancient languages is <strong>'Stone of Dread and Fear'</strong>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"y4pRACjo50IZ62pc":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"}}}

Having been married to the somewhat abusive, <span style=\"color:#bf2e0a\">@JournalEntry[DsoostwDcCWbrtFg]{Garan Conway}</span>, a captain of the guards at <span style=\"color:#bf2e0a\">@JournalEntry[zwoPmdRTNCzjKSgX]{Claybrook Hall}</span>, she became a widow upon Leon's well-placed blow to Conway's jaw during a fight instigated by Conway himself. To a certain degree he had good reason to be that belligerent as Leon had been having an affair with Esmeralda, the two having met during Leon's time a Claybrook Hall. That Esmeralda was physically abused by her husband was one of the main reasons that she fell into a relationship with Leon. Of course, she was as admiring of his charms as he was of hers.</p>\n<p>After her husband's death, she was retained by the Claybrooks. <span style=\"color:#bf2e0a\">@JournalEntry[97x2utIAqSVb7fEN]{Harland Claybrook}</span> had suspected that his guard captain was hurting Esmeralda but was initially reluctant to step into the relationship between the man and his wife, mainly as a matter of principle. Conway's abuse became too obvious though and Harland eventually had words with Garan Conway about his behaviour. He was most disappointed to find that his words had fallen of deaf ears. Harland perhaps would not have known but his words with Conway most likely resulted in more physical abuse on Esmeralda.</p>\n<p>On the day of his death and prior to trawling round the taverns in the centre of <span style=\"color:#bf2e0a\">@JournalEntry[wIIvMqJJxCnuPxPB]{Ragarth}</span> and finding Leon, Conway had confronted his wife and left her battered and bleeding at their home. She was found by another lady's maid and the alarm was raised. Esmeralda was only just able to state that her husband had gone to the city looking for Leon. Harland and is brothers and a few men had left Claybrook Hall to find either or both. As it happened all that they did find was a gathering of people around the now deceased Garan Conway.</p>\n<p>They gathered as much information as possible from the witnesses there and organised a man-hunt for Leon. However, the latter had used his skills to avoid being seen leaving Ragarth, ultimately arriving at <span style=\"color:#bf2e0a\">@JournalEntry[drmEVSH8cvkBtLiH]{Sanseer City}</span>.</p>\n<p>As Esmeralda recovered she was able to relate the whole story to Harland, <span style=\"color:#bf2e0a\">@JournalEntry[24KQiXOhiDL3CSL2]{Fran Claybrook}</span> and <span style=\"color:#bf2e0a\">@JournalEntry[w7mrkYSI9N6PknFx]{Evan Claybrook}</span>. The brothers had a great deal of sympathy for Esmeralda and Harland in particular felt some responsibility for her condition, believing that if he had acted more demonstrably and sooner that all of the recent events would have not transpired as they did. Esmeralda believes that the search for Leon was more a matter of being seen to do the right thing, especially as the full story of the fight became known.</p>\n<p>It was suggested to Esmeralda that she remain with the family in their employ should she so wish and that she should, perhaps, revert to her maiden name of Hayset.

The green jewel that formed the centre of the sceptre's head is otherwise known as <span class=\"journal-link\">@JournalEntry[Of1qZaEFgem9VTKB]{The Lost Heart of O'Shan}</span>. This jewel is thought to have been found and cut by a <span class=\"journal-link\">@JournalEntry[fj21otTBB5oc6Dcs]{Meredin}</span> jewel smith by the name of <span class=\"journal-link\">@JournalEntry[QRPyd13l2mylCV3P]{Jas'mar Sokur}</span>. Sokur was a follower of the ancient Meredin goddess <span class=\"journal-link\">@JournalEntry[jjZVEFlbu7br7i8N]{O'Shan}</span>. He named the jewel in reference to one of the ancient tales of O'Shan. He presented it to the then emperor of Meredin as a gift. The emperor was pleased but had Sokur beheaded as he did not want him crafting one that could possibly outdo the Heart and the emperor must have the best in the world. Sokur's work is highly sought after.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"shadow-highlight\">The Head</strong>. The head itself is a gold latticed casement which opens and has a setting in which to place the jewel. It has long been thought that this was made by the legendary goldsmith <span class=\"journal-link\">@JournalEntry[o0eRvO1SBCExUd3P]{T'Vran Malgrave}</span>. In general, pieces by him are sought after and would, if provenance could be verified, be worth an insane amount of money. Its history is less clear than the Heart. Malgrave was also from Meredin. This piece of work was more than likely made before the Heart. It may well have been the emperors collection for some time before he was presented with the Heart.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"shadow-highlight\">The Staff</strong>. This has a setting at one end that will accept the head of the Sceptre. The staff is made from an ancient Yew Tree, that as far as Osric knows is still living. Many rumours abound as to its whereabouts but that is not the focus of this task. The people of Meredin believed in opposing forces coming together to become something more powerful due to that conflict. The staff made from the Yew Tree is very much a passive earth energy. While the Heart is also of the earth it at some point was imbued with conflicting magic. These two put together and amplified by the golden lattice made the Sceptre very powerful.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The then emperor of Meredin, <span class=\"journal-link\">@JournalEntry[kGzxoTVtwR3Edq3i]{Pir'Lanash}</span>, was not entirely sane and he studied the dark magics which led him to put these three elements together. With the Sceptre he maintained power long after he would naturally have died. His reign was not a pleasant one either. Finally he was taken down and the Sceptre broken and the pieces lost. But there have always been clues for those who knew where to look. Fortunately those people are very very few. Osric is dubious about finding all the pieces again but unless the Sceptre needs the wielding of those ancient magicks and they have been lost. No-one now lives who understands them.</p>\n<p>Osric has since stated that the meaning of Vor Layder in the ancient languages is <strong class=\"shadow-highlight\">'Stone of Dread and Fear'</strong>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"y4pRACjo50IZ62pc":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"}}}

I want certain deaths to be known to be the will of the Twelve. The cretin let him live - or at least let him escape which is the same thing - forcing me to send another. Seeing as the shit-stain had come back empty-handed I slowly cut his hands off as an object lesson. His wailing as a result of this punishment became too much, so I roasted him on a spit for the others to see.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<div class=\"journal-content\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>The second cretinous worm I sent to Halith actually managed to surmount his mental deficiencies and return with some useful information - and the head of Doren con Grath.

At least the sacrifice of that 'pure as snow' daughter of mine should cleanse me of Drayton';s inebriated and inept fumblings. I do not yet know if he has worked out he will soon be a loose end. His sexual predilections have now stretched to my daughter to the point that he thinks that she is his reward. Plans to flee to Sha-Ren Tar I believe.

To a certain degree he had good reason to be that belligerent as Leon had been having an affair with Esmeralda, the two having met during Leon's time a Claybrook Hall. That Esmeralda was physically abused by her husband was one of the main reasons that she fell into a relationship with Leon. Of course, she was as admiring of his charms as he was of hers.</p>\n<p>After her husband's death, she was retained by the Claybrooks. <span class=\"journal-link\">@JournalEntry[97x2utIAqSVb7fEN]{Harland Claybrook}</span> had suspected that his guard captain was hurting Esmeralda but was initially reluctant to step into the relationship between the man and his wife, mainly as a matter of principle. Conway's abuse became too obvious though and Harland eventually had words with Garan Conway about his behaviour. He was most disappointed to find that his words had fallen of deaf ears. Harland perhaps would not have known but his words with Conway most likely resulted in more physical abuse on Esmeralda.</p>\n<p>On the day of his death and prior to trawling round the taverns in the centre of <span class=\"journal-link\">@JournalEntry[wIIvMqJJxCnuPxPB]{Ragarth}</span> and finding Leon, Conway had confronted his wife and left her battered and bleeding at their home. She was found by another lady's maid and the alarm was raised. Esmeralda was only just able to state that her husband had gone to the city looking for Leon. Harland and is brothers and a few men had left Claybrook Hall to find either or both. As it happened all that they did find was a gathering of people around the now deceased Garan Conway.</p>\n<p>They gathered as much information as possible from the witnesses there and organised a man-hunt for Leon. However, the latter had used his skills to avoid being seen leaving Ragarth, ultimately arriving at <span class=\"journal-link\">@JournalEntry[drmEVSH8cvkBtLiH]{Sanseer City}</span>.</p>\n<p>As Esmeralda recovered she was able to relate the whole story to Harland, <span class=\"journal-link\">@JournalEntry[24KQiXOhiDL3CSL2]{Fran Claybrook}</span> and <span class=\"journal-link\">@JournalEntry[w7mrkYSI9N6PknFx]{Evan Claybrook}</span>.

He likes Holly, believing her to be the best of the family.</p>\n<p>He has denied the accounts of Holly being at the Marshall of Kesh, another one of his enterprises stations. He had been suspicious of The Innkeeper for some while. Not only was the man rather strange but he was skimming more than Inglis would reasonably expect a factor to skim. He was having him surveilled but his men kept losing him round corners and bends with the strange man having left no clue as to where he had gone.</p>\n<p>Inglis has given you advice that the family Claybrook may be involved in Holly's abduction. There was much rivalry between the Brakefields and the Claybrooks in the past and while Godfrey and Old Man Claybrook had ironed out differences and come to a truce, it is certain that Evan Claybrook was not happy with the new arrangements. Possibly some of his brothers felt similarly.</p>\n<p>Inglis view of Evan Claybrook is that he is a sloppy operator and could well have made mistakes and left an evidence trail. Whether this can be seen around Ragarth, e.g. rumours in inns, people he may have engaged in the abduction or more likely somewhere in Claybrook Hall he cannot truly say.</p>\n<p>He cannot commit to the certainty that the Claybrooks are involved, however he did say that the Claybrooks keep a close eye on the Brakefields regardless. And that means that there is likely evidence at the Hall of whatever happened to Holly, even if they were not the culprits themselves.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"modules/sanseer/media/journals/characters/portraits/inglis-allan.jpg","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"y4pRACjo50IZ62pc":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"_lasttab":"description","scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"}}}
